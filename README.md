# Data-Analysis-Projects

This repository contains multiple data analysis projects leveraging various technologies and tools such as Snowflake, MySQL, Amazon S3, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. The projects cover a range of domains, from renewable energy analysis to insurance and pizzeria data analysis, showcasing different approaches to data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and security implementation.

## Projects

### 1. Renewable Energy Analysis(https://github.com/m0hit5/Renewable-Energy-Analysis)
**Technologies:** Snowflake, MySQL, Amazon S3, Tableau

- **Data Transformation & Loading:** Loaded and transformed renewable energy data into Snowflake, processing over 500 rows of household-level energy usage and cost savings data. 
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Utilized Snowflake SQL for data cleaning and transformation to ensure accurate insights for various regions and energy sources.
- **Dashboard Development:** Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing monthly energy consumption and cost savings across 3+ energy sources, making it easy to compare energy usage patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities for both urban and rural households.
- **Data Access & Integration:** Created an Amazon S3 bucket for streamlined data access, connecting Snowflake to Tableau, which improved data loading speeds by 25% and enabled real-time reporting for timely insights.

### 2. Insurance Data Analysis(https://github.com/m0hit5/Insurance-Data-Analysis)
**Technologies:** MySQL, Power BI, Python

- **Data Analysis:** Performed data analysis by importing more than 1,000 rows of insurance data into MySQL. Used Power BI to create dynamic visualizations, including slicers, bar charts, donut charts, and ribbon charts, to uncover insights about policies and claims.
- **Security Implementation:** Implemented role-level security (RLS) in Power BI to restrict access to sensitive insurance data based on 3+ user roles, improving data privacy and compliance with regulations.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrated sentiment analysis with Power Query to improve reporting functionality, increasing reporting efficiency by 20%. Optimized data refreshes to ensure real-time insights into claims, policies, and premiums.

### 3. Pizzeria Data Analysis(https://github.com/m0hit5/Pizzeria-Data-Analysis)
**Technologies:** MySQL, Power BI

- **Database Design & Querying:** Designed and developed a comprehensive SQL database from scratch for tracking customer orders, stock levels, and staff data. Focused on relational database management and normalization techniques to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Extraction & Analysis:** Crafted custom SQL queries to extract and analyze key data, including aggregations, calculations, and table joins, to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation and extraction.
- **Power BI Integration:** Seamlessly integrated the SQL database with Power BI to build interactive dashboards that enable easy data visualization and analysis, providing actionable insights for business stakeholders.
